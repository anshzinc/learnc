-devpkg:
-
-What is it?
-- Simple C program to install other software
-- Uses a portable library called Apache Portable Runtine (APR) which provides
-  many handy C functions which work on tons of platforms, including Windows.
-
-How is it used?
-- devpkg has 3 commands.
-- devpkg -S
-	Set up a new install on a computer.
-- devpkg -I
-	Installs a piece of software from a URL
-- devpkg -L
-	Lists all software that's been installed
-- devpkg -F
-	Fetches some source code for manual building
-- devpkg -B
-	Builds fetches sources code and installs it, even if already installed.
-
-Design:
-- External commands like curl, git and tar will be used.
-- A simple file database at /usr/local/.devpkg to keep track of what's installed.
-- Always /usr/local as install path.
-- It's assumed that most software can install with just configuire; make; make
-  install and maybe configure is optional. If the software can't at a minimum
-  do that then there's some options to modify the commands, but otherwise devpkg
-  won't bother.
-- Assued that the user can become root using sudo.
